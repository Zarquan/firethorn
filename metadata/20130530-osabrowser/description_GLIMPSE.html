<p> The <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/glimpse/" target=_top>GLIMPSE</a> (Galactic Legacy
Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire) Archive is an implementation
of the <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/glimpse/glimpsedata.html" target=_top>GLIMPSE
Highly Reliable Catalogue</a> (GLMxC) and the <a href="http://www.astro.wisc.edu/glimpse/glimpsedata.html" target=_top>
GLIMPSE More Complete Archive</a> (GLMxA), where x denotes the different data
products I or II, resp. We hold the intermediate revision (dated 9th April
2005) as well as the version 2.0 data (dated 16th April 2007 for GLIMPSEI and
18th April 2008 for GLIMPSEII).
This implementation uses the same default values as specified by GLIMPSE.<br><p>
GLIMPSE is a fully sampled, confusion limited, 4-band near- to
mid-infrared survey of the inner two-thirds of the Galactic disk with a
spatial resolution of ~2 arcsec. The Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) imaged 220
square degrees at wavelengths centered on 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 microns
in the Galactic longitude range 10 deg to 65 deg on both sides of the
Galactic center and in Galactic latitude &plusmn;1 deg (GLIMPSEI) as well as
l= -10 deg to 10 deg (GLIMPSEII).<br><p>
The area covered by GLIMPSEI contains most of the star formation activity
in the Galaxy and ~70% of the molecular gas in the Galaxy. The inner
cutoff at | l | = 10 deg permits adequate sampling of both ends of the
purported ~3 kpc central bar and possibly some of the nuclear bulge
stellar population. We expect to determine the asymmetry of the bar
(brighter at l &gt; 0 deg) with high accuracy. The outer cutoff at | l | = 65 deg
includes all of the 5 kpc molecular ring, the Sagittarius spiral arm
tangent, and the Norma spiral arm tangent. The Galactic center region is
not included because of its extreme background brightness and high
confusion limits.<br>
GLIMPSEII imaged longitudes &plusmn;10 deg of the central region of
the Galaxy. The latitude coverage is &plusmn;1 deg from | l | = 10 deg to 5 deg,
&plusmn;1.5 deg from | l | = 5 deg to 2 deg, and &plusmn;2 deg from
| l | = 2 deg to 0 deg. GLIMPSEII coverage excludes the Galactic center region
l = &plusmn;1 deg, b = &plusmn;0.75 deg observed by the GALCEN GO program (PID=3677).
