<p>The <b>VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy Survey (VIKING)</b> survey
provides an important complement to the optical KIDS project. VIKING will
image the same 1500 square degrees of the sky in Z, Y, J, H, and K<sub>s</sub>
to a limiting magnitude 1.4 mag deeper than the UKIDSS Large Area Survey. The
near-infrared data will be used in the determination of very accurate
photometric redshifts, especially at z&gt;1, an important step in the
weak lensing analysis and the observation of baryon acoustic oscillations.
Other science drivers include the hunt for high redshift quasars, galaxy
clusters, and the study of galaxy stellar masses.
