    Scanning the whole of the ROE database system is too slow.

    Better to scan each catalog,schema,table as they are selected.

    Created with status 'created'

        Status change from 'created' to 'enabled' triggers a scan - one level only.
        If scan fails status is changed to 'error'


        interface JdbcComponent
            {

            public void scan();

            }
