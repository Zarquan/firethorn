    Looking at UCDs and metadata on WFAU catalogs with Nick.



        Convention - add a .? or ;? to a UCD if not sure.
        Flags it for review later.

        Firethorn will truncate ? before publishing.


    Vista
    
        Uses new UCDs, but some are missing

    WFCAM
    
        Most recent is UDF release
        Most uses new format UCDs, but detection table uses old format

        Most of Multi-frame uses new format, but some blanks (???) and some old format.

        Source table and detection table using all old format ....
            Equivalent tables in VSA have already been done, so we can copy from them.
            Fairly easy to do, using values from tables already done.

        Curation table - using new format, but several blanks.

    VSA

        Quite a few blanks, especially hierarchical ESA keywords.

        Things like temperature of the mirror .. what UCDs do we use ?

        Some mantion units (deg K) in the text but not in the units column.
        
    Akari, Eros, 
    
        ra, dec and cartesian HTM are filled in, rest are blank

    External catalogs

        Quite a few, but reasonably obvious.
        Automated compare with other sources, CDS etc.

        Deep K band mag, and K band at epoch 1 and epoch 2 .. all have the same UCD ?
