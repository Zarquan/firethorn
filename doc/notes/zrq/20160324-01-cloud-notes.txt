    /48 - Typical assignment for larger sites (/48 = 65536 /64)

    /56 - Minimal end sites assignment[3] (e.g. Home network) (/56 = 256 /64)

    /64 - Single End-user LAN (default prefix size for SLAAC)

    Customers are allocated a /48 block of addresses
    /48 = 65536 * /64

    A CPE (ADSL) line will have one or more /64 block routed to it

        Allocated : 2001:8b0:be72::/48
        Routed    : 2001:8b0:be72:d4ea::/64

    Digital Ocean IPV6 addresses are /64
    
    Each Droplet (virtual machine) is allocated a public  IPv4 address.
    Each Droplet (virtual machine) is allocated a private 10. IPv4 address.

    Each Droplet (virtual machine) is allocated a public a /124 IPv6 range of 16 addresses.

    Public IPv4

        Address : 46.101.38.168
        Gateway : 46.101.0.1
        Netmask : 255.255.192.0 

    Private IPv4

        Address : 10.131.14.227 
        Netmask : 255.255.0.0 

    Public IPv6

        Active  : 2a03:b0c0:1:d0::1d7:2001/64

    Using OpenStack Networking with IPv6
    http://docs.openstack.org/liberty/networking-guide/adv-config-ipv6.html

        The delegated prefixes must be /64 to work with the current
        OpenStack Networking reference implementation.

        Prefix delegation
        From the Liberty release onwards, OpenStack Networking supports IPv6 prefix delegation.

# Docker

# https://docs.docker.com/v1.8/articles/networking/

    The subnet for Docker containers should at least have a size of /80.
    This way an IPv6 address can end with the containerâ€™s MAC address and
    you prevent NDP neighbor cache invalidation issues in the Docker layer.
    
    If you have a /64 for your whole environment use /78 subnets for the
    hosts and /80 for the containers. This way you can use 4096 hosts with
    16 /80 subnets each.

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Recomended allocation (work in progress)

    RFC6177 recomends /56 as the "minimal end site assignment" for a 'home site'.
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6177

    If ROE gets a /48, and we allocate /56 to our cloud, we can split the layers
    between physical, virtual and container on byte-boundaries and still be able
    to use a /80 prefix for Docker, enabling it to use SLAAC automatic address
    configuration for containers.

        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:/48                  ROE
        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:01/56                Cloud
        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:01[00-FF]            Physical machines (256 machines in the cloud)

        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0102:/64             Physical machine prefix

        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0102:[00-FF]         OpenStack (256 virtual machines per host)

        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0102:03/72           Virtual machine prefix

        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0102:0304:/80        Prefix for Docker containers 
        xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:0102:0304:[MAC]/128  Container (SLAAC auto config)

    This does not mean that all of our containers will have public IPv6 addresses.
    In the expected use case, we will only be assigning public addresses to some of our virtual machines.

    However, by using a the same byte boundary subnets for our internal and external IPv6 addresses
    we can manage both the internal and external addresses by changing the
    top /48 prefix and keeping the rest of the subnet address the same.

    Managing Projects and Users
    In OpenStack user interfaces and documentation, a group of users is referred to as a project or tenant. These terms are interchangeable.
