# Using SSH to create a SOCKS proxy to access external resources.
#[user@laptop]

    #
    # Problem:
    # The WIFI network at ROE requires the local VPN,
    # which blocks a number of commonly used ports.
    #

    #
    # Connect a SOCKS proxy tunnel to an external host.
    ssh -D 2001 polyester.andrews.metagrid.co.uk
    
    #
    # Configure Jabber client to use SOCKS proxy on port 2001.
    # Type : SOCKS 5
    # Host : localhost
    # Port : 2001
    # Jabber traffic is now routed via the tunnel host,
    # avoiding the local network.  

#-------------------------------
# Add an alias to our SSH config.
#[user@laptop]
