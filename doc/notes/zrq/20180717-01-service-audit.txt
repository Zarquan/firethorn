-- trop01 --

Gworewia  is running the OSA firethorn.
Astoalith is running the OSA Apache proxy.
Cadelicia is running the GUI/firethorn/ogsadai for the Genius demo

What are the others running ?

    Delild
    Froeseth

-- djer --

The OSA user interface is runnng on djer itself.
What do we need to do to move the OSA GUI into a VM/container on trop02 and configure it to ue the same firethorn services as the OSA TAP service ?

There are six VMs on djer, only coccinea and pyracantha are still running.
My guess is we can delete the others?

Coccinea is running the firethorn service.
    Originally installed in 2013, last updated Jan 2015.
    There is a 2.2G catalina.out file that covers Jan 2016 to now.
    It is using FirethornUserdataDJER011128LIVE for the user data.

Pyracantha is running the ogsadai service.
    Originally installed in 2013, last updated Jan 2015.
    There is a 94M catalina.log file that covers Jan 2015 to now.
    Looks like it handles around 10 to 20 queries per month.

-- shep --
 
There were three VMs still running on shep.

    pyratest1
    pyratest2
    pyratest3

I have shut them down but not deleted them yet. Do we need anythng from them ?
