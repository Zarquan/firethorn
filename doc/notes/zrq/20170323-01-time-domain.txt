            flux + error, filter  (mag or relative mag)

            velocity, error    e.g. trace of solar activity

            spectra             e.g. repeated spectra fof gamma ray burst

        magnitude relative to [comparison star]
        



FR - concern about modelling pixel data (images/spectra) as sparse
If some are sparse and some not, complex ?

    Should we *recomend* a specific time representation ?
    
    Not mandatory, but recomended.

        time system
        relative time - simulation results
