    User interface
        OSA interface re-branded for H-Atlas
            GetImage etc from WebPy
            Using Mike's Java code
            A-Atlas have some scripts for extracting images 


    Standard library of tools and things that other projects can adapt themselves
    HAtlas will help us to define those tools
    Will need more hand holding at the start
    OSA is a good start
    Exporting with SAMP etc

    Scientists used to using SQL
    Offer introductory examples
    They will take those and develop more
    More and better examples


    User data
        Workspaces
            Pulling resources into them
        Based on earlier OSA designs
            Logical ordering of things

    Work with them from the start
    Iterative development
    Grow it gradually

    Interaction with HAtlas people
        Make our work more visible
        Progress will need to be visible
