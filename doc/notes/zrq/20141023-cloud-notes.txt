    Microsoft “loves Linux” as it makes Azure bigger, better
    http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2014/10/microsoft-loves-linux-as-it-makes-azure-bigger-better/

    Nadella told us that some 20 percent of VMs on Azure use the open source operating system.

    Two new Australian regions are coming on line, taking Azure up to 19 in total.
    This is twice as many as Amazon's AWS platform, three times as many as Google.
    Each region sports about 600,000 servers, for a grand total of more than 11 million.

    Last year's capital expenditure on Azure was $4.5 billion - meaning that functionally, only Microsoft, Amazon, and Google can compete at this scale.
