---+ VO data types

A review of the data types defined in the VO specifications.

---++ !VODataService
#VODataService

The [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification defines an XML schema for describing data collections and the services that access them.

This review refers to [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VODataService/20101202/REC-VODataService-1.1-20101202.html][version 1.1 (20101202)]] of the specification.

The data types defined in [[#VODataService][VODataService]] are intended to be used to describe the data in VO data sets and the services and protocols used to access them.

---++ !DataType
#DataType

[[#DataType][DataType]] is a XML element defined in the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification that is used as a common base class for defining data types.

[[#DataType][DataType]] defines the following attributes:

   * =[[#arraysize][arraysize]]=
   * =[[#delim][delim]]=
   * =[[#extendedType][extendedType]]=
   * =[[#extendedSchema][extendedSchema]]=

---++ !TableDataType
#TableDataType

[[#TableDataType][TableDataType]] is a XML element defined in the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification that is used as a common base class for defining data types for table columns.

[[#TableDataType][TableDataType]] extends [[#DataType][DataType]].

---++ !VOTableType
#VOTableType

[[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] is a XML element defined in the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification that describes data types defined in the [[#VOTable][VOTable]] specification.

[[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] inherits the following attributes from [[#DataType][DataType]]:

   * =[[#arraysize][arraysize]]=
   * =[[#delim][delim]]=
   * =[[#extendedType][extendedType]]=
   * =[[#extendedSchema][extendedSchema]]=

[[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] defines the following set of allowed values:

   * =boolean=
   * =bit=
   * =unsignedByte=
   * =short=
   * =int=
   * =long=
   * =char=
   * =unicodeChar=
   * =float=
   * =double=
   * =floatComplex=
   * =doubleComplex=

Notes:

[[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] is described in [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VODataService/20101202/REC-VODataService-1.1-20101202.html#tbldatatypes][section 3.5.3]] of the specification.

In the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification, [[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] is described as _"data types that correspond to the parameter and column types defined in the VOTable schema"_

In the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] XML schema, [[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] is described as _"a data type supported explicitly by the VOTable format"_.

The definition of [[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] does not provide any further details about the sizes, ranges or content of the data types. It is left to the reader to refer to the [[#VOTable][VOTable]] specification for details about the data types.

In the bibliography the reference to the [[#VOTable][VOTable]] specification explicitly refers to [[http://www.ivoa.net/Documents/VOTable/20091130/REC-VOTable-1.2.html][version 1.2 (20091130)]] of the specification, this has since been superceded by [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOTable/20130920/REC-VOTable-1.3-20130920.html][version 1.3 (20130920)]].

The  definition of [[#VOTableType][VOTableType]] states that string values of arbitrary length are represented by a data type of =char= with =arraysize="*"=. This excludes the option of using =unicodeChar= as the data type with =arraysize="*"=. It may be clearer to explicitly state *ASCII strings* are represented by =char= with =arraysize="*"= and *unicode strings* are represented by =unicodeChar= and =arraysize="*"=.

---++ !TAPDataType
#TAPDataType

[[#TAPDataType][TAPDataType]] is a XML element defined in the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification that describes a base class for data types defined in the <strike>[[#TAP][TAP]]</strike> [[#ADQL][ADQL]] specification.


[[#TAPDataType][TAPDataType]] defines the following attributes:

   * [[#size]]

Notes:

The XML element name reflects the historical situation where the data types were originally defined in the [[#TAP][TAP]] specification. The data type definitions have since been moved to the [[#ADQL][ADQL]] specification, but for compatibility reasons, the XML element name has not been changed.

---++ !TAPType
#TAPType

[[#TAPType][TAPType]] is a XML element defined in the [[#VODataService][VODataService]] specification that describes data types defined in the <strike>[[#TAP][TAP]]</strike> [[#ADQL][ADQL]] specification.

[[#TAPType][TAPType]] inherits the following attributes from [[#DataType][DataType]]:

   * =[[#arraysize][arraysize]]=
   * =[[#delim][delim]]=
   * =[[#extendedType][extendedType]]=
   * =[[#extendedSchema][extendedSchema]]=

[[#TAPType][TAPType]] inherits the following attributes from [[#TAPDataType][TAPDataType]]:

   * =[[#size][size]]=

[[#TAPType][TAPType]] defines the following set of allowed values:

   * =BOOLEAN=
   * =SMALLINT=
   * =INTEGER=
   * =BIGINT=
   * =REAL=
   * =DOUBLE=
   * =TIMESTAMP=
   * =CHAR=
   * =VARCHAR=
   * =BINARY=
   * =VARBINARY=
   * =POINT=
   * =REGION=
   * =CLOB=
   * =BLOB=

Notes:

[[#TAPType][TAPType]] is described in [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/VODataService/20101202/REC-VODataService-1.1-20101202.html#tbldatatypes][section 3.5.3]] of the specification.

The XML element name reflects the historical situation where the data types were originally defined in the [[#TAP][TAP]] specification. The data type definitions have since been moved to the [[#ADQL][ADQL]] specification, but for compatibility reasons, the XML element name has not been changed.

The definition of [[#TAPType][TAPType]] does not provide any further details about the sizes, ranges or content of the data types. It is left to the reader to refer to the <strike>[[#TAP][TAP]]</strike> [[#ADQL][ADQL]] specification for details about the data types.

The definition of [[#TAPType][TAPType]] states that string values should be represented by a data type of =VARCHAR=, the definition does not say whether this should be accompanied by an =arraysize= attribute.
