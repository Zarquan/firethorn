Existing indexes

    ra          ra  asc
    dec         dec asc
    extSeq      extNum asc, seqNum asc
    htmid       htmid asc
    objid       objid asc
    pk          multiframeid asc, extnum asc, seqnum asc


Bin the values based on objId.

    SELECT
        (objId & 0xFFFF),
        count(*)
    FROM
        ATLASDR1.dbo.atlasDetection
    WHERE
        objid > 0
    GROUP BY
        (objId & 0xFFFF)

    Looks like a fairly even spread across all the boxes ..

We can't index by a bit wise operation.

Creating a random number for each column is a lot of work :-(

    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1045138/how-do-i-generate-random-number-for-each-row-in-a-tsql-select
    http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/DataMgmt/DataDesign/sql-server-set-based-random-numbers/

Create an index by spreading an integer value across the set evenly

    objId & 0xFF would repeat every 256 rows
    
Create a new 8 bit column

    mask = (objId & 0xFF)

Selecting a particular value would get 1/256 of the data

    select .. AND (bitmask = 0x01)

Selecting a particular range should be fast
    4/256 of the data

    select .. AND (bitmask < 4)

So what would the cost be ?
