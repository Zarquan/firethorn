    195 pages of good ideas

    Most of them fairly specific.

    Do we need to say what a Data Science Platform is ?

    Oracle have bought 'datascience.com'

        Oracle
        What is a data science platform
        https://www.datascience.com/blog/what-is-a-data-science-platform

            "A data science platform is a software hub around which all data
            science work takes place. That work usually includes integrating
            and exploring data from various sources, coding and building models
            that leverage that data, deploying those models into production,
            and serving up results, whether that’s through model-powered
            applications or reports."

            "The best data science platforms offer the flexibility of
            open-source tools and the scalability of elastic compute
            resources."

        Oracle
        Platform features
        https://www.datascience.com/blog/data-science-platform-cloud-machine-learning-on-premises

            * Flexible deployments:
                The platform can now be deployed on-premises, or through cloud providers such as
                Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. New features focused on
                IT operations enable easy installation, monitoring, and maintenance.

            * Improved project organization and collaboration among teams:
                Platform users can organize data, code, and model outputs into projects, making it
                easier to locate relevant files. The platform also removes the need to configure
                new environments for every project; instead, users can set up repeatable,
                standardized environments with Docker or other containers.

            * Faster and higher-value analyses:
                Data scientists can work in their code editors of choice and run that code seamlessly
                in the platform. Infrastructure can be scaled up or down depending on the demands
                of an analysis.

            * More visible results:
                Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown documents, and other files associated with a project
                can be published as sharable reports. Code versioning allows teams to track changes
                and project milestones, so work doesn’t get lost.

            * Streamlined production:
                Code can be run on a schedule to automate common data science tasks like data
                cleaning and model retraining, as well as deployed behind a REST API for easy
                integration with real-time applications or dashboards.

        Best data science tools for modelling and deploying machine learning and predictive algorithms
        https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/data/best-data-science-platforms-3656536/

            Gartner defines data science platforms simply as "engines for creating machine-learning solutions".
            For the sake of this article we have broadened Gartner's definition to include everything from data
            science workbenches, where teams can collaborate on code and deploy it themselves, to guided data
            science solutions.

        16 top platforms for data science and machine learning 
        https://www.information-management.com/slideshow/16-top-platforms-for-data-science-and-machine-learning

            Gartner defines a data science and machine-learning platform as
            “A cohesive software application that offers a mixture of basic building blocks essential both for
            creating many kinds of data science solution and incorporating such solutions into business processes,
            surrounding infrastructure and products.”

            Same question as us : "Will the platform be integrated at ESAC?"
