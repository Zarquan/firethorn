    # So callbacks got through from OGSA-DAI to Firethorn with no problem.
    # tester client had stopped listening by the time the query CMPLETED
    # Network error meant ssh terminal had already died by the time the query timed out.
    #

    #
    # tester terminal was quiet, so without a keepalive it might fail.
    # Firethorn and OGSA-DAI terminals were very active, so not lack of traffic.
    #

    #
    # Internal networking continued to work as planned.
    # External networking failed ... and then recovered after some time.
    #

    #
    # Both Stelios and I have seen similar symptoms on other VMs.
    # Not specific to this VM or this test.
