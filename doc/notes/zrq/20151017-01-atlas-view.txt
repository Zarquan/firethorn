    # Experiment - using a view to reduce the row count.

    # Tested ADQL queries via the live OSA interface.

    # Example query - takes several minuites

    # on the same data, and get the same results, then it doesn't
    # matter how long the query takes or how many results are returned
    # as long as they are the same.

    # Created a view using the SQLServer management tool.
