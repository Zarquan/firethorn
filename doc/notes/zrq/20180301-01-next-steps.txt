    Use case from Andy :

        event from atlas
            might be an interesting quasar ?
                turns out it might be a combination of two objects
                requires manual analysis to look for clues
        
            xray with an error elipse
                go and look at what is in that elipse

            start with data from a catalog 
                find the images that match that data
                    human analysis

        COORDSYS - what os preventing us from accepting the proposed changes into voevent-2.1 ?
