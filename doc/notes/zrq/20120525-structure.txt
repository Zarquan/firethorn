# FireThorn services

firethorn-core

    TAP service
    TAP factory

        spring controller
        hibernate data

    TAP service and TAP factory are just web front ends to our back end system
    just pushing things around in our database    

    why two separate services ?

    tap service
    (TAP service and TAP factory)

        tap factory
            create instance

        tap instance
            lifetime
            using
                service:alias
                service:alias

        tap query
            instance ->
            adql

        uws job
            owner ->
            lifetime
            status
            results ->

    identity

        identity

        action

        group

    storage
    (local tables for user data)
        user space
            lifetime
            status
            owner ->
            meta ->

            user table
                lifetime
                status
                owner ->
                meta ->

    metadata
    (metadata from registry and vosi)
        FTM service
            FTM catalog
                FTM schema
                    FTM table
                        FTM column


    Allow Hibernate to manage our collections ?
