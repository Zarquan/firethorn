Create a metadata tree from JDBC resource


    //Widgeon.Factory.create(DataSource)
    Widgeon.Core.Factory.create(DataSource)


    Reads the metadata from the JDBC connection and creates the tree.
    Admin (owner) then 'disables' some of the elements, and sets display name on others.
    Each element has a enabled|disabled status, enum EnabledStatus { ENABLED(), DISABLED(); }
    Each element has a display name, which defaults to the name if not set.
    Each element has an owner (even if is anon-xxx), every web session creates a new owner.

    // Create a view of a resource
    widgeon.views().select()
    widgeon.views().create(String name)

    // Can we skip this step for now ?
    // Is there anything prevent us creating two resources (Widgeons) from the same JDBC entity ?
    // If so, then this is not a problem at the moment.
    // Later, we want OGSA-DAI to be able to figure out that two tables are in fact the same JDBC entity.

------------------

    // TAP service built by combining one or more *resources* (Widgeons).

    // One Widgeon for the main ROE SQLServer system
    // Separate views for each of the TAP services
    // Data is stored because we don't want to query and process the JDBC metedata every time
    // Reload method to re-query the JDBC metadata (reload) - what about JDBC passwords etc ?
    // New tables in JDBC DataSource are automatically harvested.

    // Adding views allows Mark to control visibility of each table. 
    // 2MASS view just shows the 2MASS tables, plus the relevant neighbour tables.

    // One Widgeon for each users data space - one whole database each.
    // Default view shows all of the users tables. 

    // How do we create new databases when users register ?
    // How do we create new OGSA-DAI resources when users register ?
    // How do we create new Widgeon resources when users register ?


    // A user can publish a new view of their data, providing public access to some datasets.


    // Basic TAP service, based on a view of a local resource.
    // Combined TAP service, based on local and remote resources.

    TAPService

        // The resources this service provides access to. 
        Iter<Widgeon.View> views.select()
        Widgeon.View views.insert(Widgeon.View)

        // Requests via this service get mapped from the view to the real resources.
        // Short term fix to use 'schema' as the view name ?




    Core
        Schema
            Catalog
                Table
                    Column

    View
        Schema
            Catalog
                Table
                    Column


    View objects are manufactured from 

        Core id
        View id

            SchemaView
                Schema id
                View   id

            TableView
                Table id
                View   id

    Update problems - what happens when a new Schema/Catalog/Table/Column is added to the resource ?
    This can be
        a) Remote VOSI resource modifed and re-harvested
        b) Local JDBC resource modifed and re-harvested

        c) Local user database modifed and re-harvested

    If we default to 'enabled' then local TAP services will start to publish things that haven't been reviewed.
    If we default to 'disabled', then how do we get things enabled.
    3rd state - NEW, indicates that a resource is disabled because it hasn't been reviewed yet. 
    Everything starts as NEW, and then gets set to ENABLED or DISABLED.

---------------------------

    Use case for Widgeon.Views

    SQLServer system has a 'uber-database' that mounts read only copies of all the databases.

    We want the TAP service for the 2MASS database to provide the 2MASS tables,
    plus the relevant neighbour tables.

    We want the UKIDSS service for the UKIDSS database to provide the UKIDSS tables,
    plus the relevant neighbour tables.

    We want to hide the uber-database from public view.

    We want OGSA-DAI to know that the 2MASS and UKIDSS databases are part of the local uber-database
    and not to try to re-write joins between them.

    We want OGSA-DAI to know that the user data is visible as part of the local uber-database
    and not to try to re-write joins between them.

    We want OGSA-DAI to write to the separate user data database.

    Widgeon.Views gives us a mecanism to perform the smoke and mirrors
    required to implement the above.

---------------------------

    Initial system - ship the Widgeon.Views and just make TAP service
    use one or more Widgeon as the metadata source.

Debugging the Hibernate not working problem.

    [AssertionFailure] HHH000099:
        an assertion failure occured (this may indicate a bug in Hibernate, but is more likely due to unsafe use of the session):
            org.hibernate.AssertionFailure: Interceptor.onPrepareStatement() returned null or empty string. 

    [HibernateTransactionManager] Initiating transaction rollback after commit exception 
    org.hibernate.AssertionFailure: Interceptor.onPrepareStatement() returned null or empty string.

    #
    # Actually - bug is more than problems with collection.
    # Hibernate is just not updating any persisten entities.


    #
    # Tried using a PostgreSQL database instead.

    #
    # Create the test user.
    su - postgres -c 'createuser --no-superuser --no-createdb --no-createrole --pwprompt mallard'

    #
    # Create the test database.
    su - postgres -c 'createdb --owner mallard widgeon'
