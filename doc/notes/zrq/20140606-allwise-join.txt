    Subject: Fwd: allwise catalogue for Hyades brown dwarfs

    > I have tried to select L and T dwarfs in the Hyades from the WISE vs GCS DR10 cross-match but it turns out to be disappointing for the moment. I know that there is an allwise catalogue where WISE data have been stacked (see link below).

    > It would be useful to cross-match this updated version of WISE with the GCS. Any possibility to upload it on WSA?
