Notes from the TAP/ADQL splinter session on [[http://wiki.ivoa.net/twiki/bin/view/IVOA/InterOpMay2014][Wednesday 21 May 2014]] at the [[http://www.sciops.esa.int/index.php?project=CONF2014&page=IVOA2014][IVOA Interop meeting]] at ESAC.

During the meeting the group reviewed a number of proposed changes to TAP and ADQL described in the [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html][TAP Implementation Notes Version 1.0]].

The following section lists the recommendations agreed at the meeting for each of the changes that were reviewed.

After each section there is a table for adding feedback. Please add your vote to indicate

   * +1 You agree with the decision
   * 0 You don't mind either way
   * -1 You disagree with the decision

If you vote to disagree please provide a brief explanation describing why (or a link to a new page if you prefer).

If you feel that an item needs more discussion please feel free to raise it on the working group [[http://www.ivoa.net/pipermail/dal/][mailing list]].

Thank you for your feedback. -- IVOA.DaveMorris - 2014-09-04

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
_A brief summary of the discussion at the May Interop._

| IVOA.MarcoMolinaro | 2014-09-04 | +1 | Yes, good idea |
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | 0 | Ok, as long as it is optional |
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | -1 | It isn't the right colour, our users prefer blue background. |

---+++ Separator Nonterminal
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#ac-sep][item]] proposes two options to clarify the use of whitespace and comments in ADQL.

One option for such a clarification is to amend section 2.1 of [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] with a subsection 2.1.4, "Tokens and literals", containing text like the following (taken essentially from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92][std:SQL1992]]).

   * Any token may be followed by a separator. A nondelimiter token shall be followed by a delimiter token or a separator.

Since the full rules for the separator are somewhat more complex in [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]], an attractive alternative could be to omit the separator nonterminal from the grammar and to just note:

   * Whitespace and comments can occur wherever they can occur in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL-92][std:SQL1992]].

---+++++ May 2014 Interop

---+++ Type System
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#ac-typesystem][item]] proposes adding new section to introduce a notion of types into section 2 of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

See [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#ac-typesystem][original text]] for details of the proposed type mappings.

---+++ Empty Coordinate Systems
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html##ac-emptycoosys][item]] proposes
deprecating the string-valued first argument for the geometry constructors (=BOX=, =CIRCLE=, =POINT=, =POLYGON=).

---+++++ May 2014 Interop

---+++ Explanation of optional features
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#ac-geo-opt][item]] proposes
adding a section of text to both the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/TAP.html][std:TAP]] and [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] specifications that clarifies how optional features are described.

---+++ Simple Crossmatch Function
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-simplecrossmatch][item]] proposes
adding a simple positional crossmatch function to [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]].

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
*Requires further discussion* -
It was agreed that the proposal needs more work done on it before it could be included in the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

   * It was agreed that this would be a useful feature for end users
   * It was noted that adding this feature could be difficult to implement
   * It was noted that part of the rationale for the IVOA services was to implement difficult things on the server side, making things easier for the end user

---+++ Generalized user defined functions
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-genudf][item]] proposes
allowing user defined functions to return geometric types.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
It was agreed that there should be no restriction on the return types of User Defined Functions.

*Futher discussion* -
It was also noted that the SimDAL working group would like to be able to define table value functions in [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]].
It was agreed to continue the discussion to find a way of adding support for table value functions in a future version of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-casefolding][item]] proposes
adding functions and operators for to support case-insensitive string comparisons.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
*Accepted for next version* -

---+++ Set operators
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html####][item]] proposes
adding support for the =UNION=, =EXCEPT= and =INTERSECT= operators.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
*Accepted for next version* -
This item was discussed by members of the working group at the May 2014 IVOA Interop meeting.

It was agreed that the following operators should be included as *required* operators in the next
(minor) version of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

   * =UNION=
   * =EXCEPT=
   * =INTERSECT=

It was agreed that the text describing the set operators in the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard should
include the following caveats.

   * The set operands MUST produce the same number of columns
   * The corresponding columns in the operands MUST have the same data types
   * The corresponding columns in the operands SHOULD have the same metadata
   * The metadata for the results SHOULD be generated from the left-hand operand

---+++++ Community feedback
| Name | date | vote | notes | 
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | -1 | I agree with the proposal (+1), but we need to confirm which platforms support what operators (see below) |
|  |  |  |  | 

The Oracle database platform includes support for =UNION= and =INTERSECT=, but not =EXCEPT=.
However, Oracle's =MINUS= operator appears to be equivalent to =EXCEPT=.

If we make these operators as a required feature of [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]]
then it means service implementations based on Oracle will have to
parse and translate ADQL queries.  

This may not be an issue, but it will be the first time we have (knowingly) added
a feature to [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] that requires service implementations to  
parse and translate ADQL queries.

-- IVOA.DaveMorris - 2014-09-04

Please contribute your knowledge to the table below to help us build a map of which
platforms support which operators.

|Vendor|version|=UNION=|=INTERSECT=|=EXCEPT=| verified by |
| SQLServer  |  | YES | YES | YES | IVOA.DaveMorris  - 2014-09-04 |
| Sybase     |  |     |     |     |   |
| Oracle     |  | YES | YES | (see below) |  |
| PostgreSQL |  | YES | YES |  YES |  |
| MySQL      |  |     |     |      |  |
| Derby      |  |     |     |      |  |
| HSQLBD     |  |     |     |      |  |
| SQLLite    |  |     |     |      |  |

*Oracle* - The Oracle database platform supports the =UNION= and =INTERSECT=,
operators directly, and the =MINUS= operator is equivalent to =EXCEPT=.

---+++ Adding a Boolean Type
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-booleans][item]] proposes
adding a BOOLEAN type to [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]].

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Requires further discussion</b> -
This item was discussed by members of the working group at the May 2014 IVOA Interop meeting.

It was agreed that although making these changes would be a good thing, more work needs to be
done on identifying and solving potential compatibility issues before the changes can be
included in the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

   * It was agreed that BOOLEAN data type would be a useful feature to add
   * It was agreed that changing the return type of CONTAINS() to be a BOOLEAN would make it easier to use
   * It was agreed that making these changes could cause compatibility issues which could not be addressed in a (minor) increment of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard
   * It was agreed that both of these changes should be considered for a future (major) increment of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard

Based on the points raised at the May 2014 Interop we would like to split this into two separate proposals
and ask for your feedback on each proposal.

---++++ Adding a Boolean Type
The first proposal is to add support for a BOOLEAN type to [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]],
without changing the return type of CONTAINS().

This would avoid the potential compatibility issues raised at the May 2014 Interop.

The general concensus at the May 2014 Interop was that a BOOLEAN data type would be useful,
and that adding it as a new type would not cause compatibility issues.
 
---+++++ Community feedback
| Name | date | vote | notes | 
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | +1 | Yes to adding BOOLEAN |
|  |  |  |  | 

---++++ changing the return type of CONTAINS()
The second proposal is to change the return type of CONTAINS().

This is the part that would potentially cause compatibility issues
with existing services and clients.

---+++++ Community feedback
| Name | date | vote | notes | 
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | +1 | Yes to changing CONTAINS() |
|  |  |  |  | 

---
---+++ Casting to Unit
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-unitcast][item]] proposes
adding a new function =IN_UNIT(expr, <character_string_literal>)= which would convert values in one unit into another.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Requires further discussion</b> -
It was agreed that the proposal needs more work done on it before it could included in the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

   * It was agreed that scaling conversions would not be difficult to implement
   * It was agreed that conversion between wavelength and frequency would be difficult to implement consistently
   * It was agreed that unit conversions would be most useful in a SELECT list
   * It was agreed that unit conversions would be most difficult to implement in a WHERE clause

---+++ Column References with UCD Patterns
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-ucdcol][item]] proposes
adding a pre-processing macro that locates columns based on their UCD.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Requires further discussion</b> -
It was agreed that the proposal needs more work done on it before it could be considered ready
to be included in the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

---+++++ Community feedback
| Name | date | vote | notes | 
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | +1 | Good idea but needs more work |
|  |  |  |  | 

---
---+++ Modulo operator
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-modulo][item]] proposes
adding the modulus operator =x % y= to the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Rejected</b> -
It was agreed that the benefits of adding the =x % y= operator syntax were outweighed by cost of
compatibility issues caused by adding a new *required* operator to the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar. 

---+++++ Community feedback
| Name | date | vote | notes | 
| IVOA.DaveMorris | 2014-09-04 | +1 | Disclosure - this is one of mine and I'm sneaking it back in (see below) |
|  |  |  |  | 

If this is the _only_ required operator we are adding, then it is probably not
worth the potential compatibility issues.

However, if we are updating the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar to add =UNION=, =EXCEPT= and =INTERSECT= as operators,
does adding the =x % y=  operator cause any additional compatibility issues ?
-- IVOA.DaveMorris - 2014-09-04

---
---+++ Bitwise operators
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-bitwise][item]] proposes
adding support for the =AND=, =OR=, =XOR= and =NOT= bitwise operations and hexadecimal literals to the
[std:ADQL] grammar.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Accepted for next version</b> -
It was agreed that hexadecimal literal values should be included in the next (minor) version
of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

<b>Accepted for next version</b> -
It was agreed that the following functions should be included as an *optional* feature in the
next (minor) version of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

   * =BIT_AND(x, y)=
   * =BIT_OR(x, y)=
   * =BIT_XOR(x, y)=
   * =BIT_NOT(x)=

<b>Rejected</b> -
It was agreed that the benefits of adding the operator, =[exp] op [exp]=, syntax for each operation
were outweighed by cost of compatibility issues caused by adding new operators to the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar.

However, if we are updating the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar to add =UNION=, =EXCEPT= and =INTERSECT= as operators,
does adding the =[exp] op [exp]= for each of the bitwise operations cause any additional compatibility issues ?

|  |  |  |  | 

---
---+++ CAST operator
This [[https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects/dal/TAPNotes/TAPNotes-fmt.html#af-cast][item]] proposes
adding a limited form of the =CAST= operator to the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] grammar.

This proposal specifically limited the =CAST= operation to numeric data types only,
and excluded =CAST= to and from character strings.

---+++++ May 2014 Interop
<b>Accepted for next version</b> -
It was agreed that the CAST operator should be including as a required operator in the next
(minor) version of the [[http://www.ivoa.net/documents/latest/ADQL.html][std:ADQL]] standard.

It was agreed that the set of type conversions should be discussed further, with a view to
finalizing the set of conversions supported in the next (minor) version of the
[std:ADQL] standard.
