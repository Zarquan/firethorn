A link to the definition of the security method element in the schema would be fine.

Is there a preferred best practice for IVOA documents for referring to schema ?

If it is anyURI, then that implies that I can use the security method element to register a service that uses a different security mechanism, simply by adding security method element with a URI or URL that identifies the security mechanism I am using.

Which is good, and provides a flexible route for adding new mechanisms in the future.

However, the wording of the text appears to exclude anything other than the approved methods, which is not so good. 

In particular, the following sentence appears to limit all VOResource webservices to using OAuth, TLS or no authentication.

"Services that are registered with a IVOA registry as having a WebService type interface [VOResource] shall support OAuth, or shall support cookies or shallsupport TLS with client certificates or shall require no authentication."


It might be good to update the text to describe how this would work for both standard and non-standard security methods.

Suggestion :

  * The security method element may contain any URI.
  * This document defines the following standard security methods which are identified by IVOA standard registry URIs.
  * For security methods which do not have a standard URI
     * The security method element should contain some form of unique URI that identifies the security method in some way.
     * The security method element should preferably contain some form of URL that points to a resource that describes the security method.
