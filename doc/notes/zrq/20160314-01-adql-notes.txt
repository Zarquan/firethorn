------------ ------------
ADQL hackathon session

    Dave Moris
    Marco Molinaro

Planning meeting concerning next steps for the ADQL specification.

------------
OFFSET/LIMIT

The current consensus on the mailing list is to accept OFFSET without LIMIT.

TODO - Dave
Write a page on the IVOA wiki summarising the OFFSET/LIMIT syntax for each of the main platforms, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLServer, Oracle etc.

If a database platform requires LIMIT, the proposed work around is to specify either (MAX_ROWS + 1) or (MAX_LONG).

However, many of the text books and online manuals describe using OFFSET with LIMIT.

TODO - Dave
Propose to the mailing list that we accept OFFSET with LIMIT, allowing LIMIT as a synonym for TOP.

The only reason for this is to make ADQL compatible with 90% of the text books and online manuals.

Hopefully this should be a short yes/no discussion and then accept the consensus for the v2.1 specification.

TODO - Dave
Update the text of the v2.1 specification to include OFFSET (with/without LIMIT as agreed).

------------
Hexadecimal literals

Adding hexadecimal literals to the BNF grammar has raised some issues.

The simple way to add them would be to extend numeric literal to allow both decimal and hexadecimal values.

If we follow a strict interpretation of the BNF, then allowing both decimal and hexadecimal values for numeric literals causes some odd side effects, particularly with scientific notation and exponents.

TODO - Dave
Write a page on the IVOA wiki detailing the issues.

TODO - Dave
Propose to the mailing list that we accept

a) Numeric literals may contain both decimal and hexadecimal values but there are places where hexadecimal values do not make sense, and developers should do the right thing.

and
    
b) The BNF grammar is not a definitive machine readable specification and there may be some unintended side effects in the BNF.

TODO - Dave
If consensus is to accept a flexible interpretation of the BNF, update the text of the v2.1 specification to reflect this.

If consensus is for a strict interpretation of the BNF, then discussion on validating a strict BNF grammar will need to be continued at the May interop.
    
------------
Crossmatch function

The mailing list has yet to agree on a consensus for the crossmatch function.
 
TODO - Marco
Write an email to the mailing list summarising the options and starting a new discussion thread.

TODO - Dave
If consensus is reached, update the text of the v2.1 specification to include the crossmatch function.

If no consensus is reached, then discussion of the crossmatch function can be continued at the May interop.

------------
v2.1 specification

The aim is to try to resolve the outstanding issues during March, and have an updated version of the specification ready for review in April.

If we are not able to reach consensus on an issue, then it should be deferred to the next version of the specification.
