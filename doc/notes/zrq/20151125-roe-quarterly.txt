    Strength/Success

        New TAP implementation
            Passing Mark Taylor's taplint tests :-)
            Gold standard for TAP services.
        
        Query parsers
            ADLQ parser > 95%
            OGSA-DAI parser > 80%

        Genius demo online
            Acccess to local tables, ATLASDR1, TWOMASS etc
            Acccess to remote tables, gaia@ESAC, icecube@GAVO
            Local/remote JOIN in development (see below)

        Docker containers
            Learning and developing expertise.
            Reproducible deployment and testing.

    Weakness/

        Error reporting
            Still mostly 'a bad thing happened'
            Work in progress to improve useability

        Low visibility
            'in progress' development work on internal
            infrastructure tends not to be visible until
            the final feature is released

    Opportunity/ToDo

        Distributed queries - DQP
            In progress
            Recent work on infrastructure improves support for DQP.
            New round of testing and development in progress.

        User data
            In progress
            Recent work on infrastructure improves support for UD.

    Threat/Risks

        Distributed queries - DQP
            Original work on this was 2013.
            Not used it for a while.
            
            New round of testing may reveal complex issues.
            Fixing the issues may delay release of DQP to users.
