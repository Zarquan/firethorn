Notes
-----

We plan to use VOEvent as the format for alert transmission
The packet will be transmitted to VOEvent Brokers
We expect the community to provide sophisticated brokers with classification engines, cross-match capabilities to other catalogs, etc.
LSST will provide a default, limited, broker.

LSST Broker:
# Keep only never-before-seen events within two 
# effective radii of a galaxy. This is for illustration 
# only; the exact methods/members/APIs may change. 
def filter(alert): 
	if len(alert.sources) > 1: 
		return False 
	nn = alert.diaobject.nearest_neighbors[0] 
	if not nn.flags.GALAXY: 
		return False 
	return nn.dist < 2. * nn.Re 
	

Each alert includes the following: 
• Alert and database ID: IDs uniquely iden)fying this alert. 
• The DIASource record that triggered the alert 
• The en)re DIAObject (or SSObject) record 
• DIASource records within the past year (stretch: all) 
• 30x30 pixel cut-out of the difference image (FITS) 
• 30x30 pixel cut-out of the template image (FITS) 

We plan for VOEvent-compliant Distributor/Brokers (hmp://voevent.org) to be the primary endpoints
of the full LSST alert streams 
− End users will then use these Distributor/Brokers to classify and filter events on the stream for 
those finng their science goals 

 VOEvent Transport Protocol (VTP; Allan & Denny, 2009). This is an IVOA Note, rather than a Recommendation
