List of WFAU Archives (for TAP services)

http://wsa.roe.ac.uk/
http://osa.roe.ac.uk/
http://vsa.roe.ac.uk/
http://ges.roe.ac.uk/ (Private, won't setup TAP for this)
http://ssa.roe.ac.uk/



Compiling list of databases to import for each
----------------------------------------------

Step 1
------

Query used to generate external catalogues with neighbour tables for each survey database:

SELECT surveyName, databaseName, extTableName, description
FROM ExternalSurvey AS s, ExternalSurveyTable AS t
WHERE s.surveyID=t.surveyID AND s.surveyID>0

(i.e. run for ATLASDR1 (OSA), VVVDR1 (VSA), VHSDR1 (VSA))


Step 2
------
Ask around WFAU for feedback 

Mark - Probably the best way to get a list is to query our existing TAP services on the registry.  If it's there, it needs to be in the new TAP.


Mike - 6dF (just DR3) would probably best fit under SSA.

Eckhard -  Just have a look at the databases in the browser pages, there you have a full list of external surveys that have neighbour tables in  the given archive:
http://vsa.roe.ac.uk/www/vsa_browser.html
http://wsa.roe.ac.uk/www/wsa_browser.html
http://ges.roe.ac.uk/www/ges_browser.html


Step 3
------
Feedback with compiled list from Step 1 from Nick Cross:
Add VHSDR4, VHSDR5 to VSA 
UKIDSSDR11PLUSUDSONLY to WSA 


Step 4
------
Manually compile SSA config, because External Survey table used in query for step 1 was not available.



Step 5
------
Query TOPCAT for available TAP services with wfau as the owner. Ensure all are covered by the list we compile
