# Issues found during testing
# Todo: Create Redmine issues with details

- TAP Async Test (All Tables):
  - Query hanging
      Investigating shows that result state does not match query status
  - Astropy Error while reading VOTable response
      "ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10:"
       .. Query returns an "img" field which has type unsignedByte in the VOTable
       .. Astropy tries to read this as an integer and fails 
        https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee625175(v=exchg.80).aspx
	"The unsignedByte data type is an integer value between 0 and 255, inclusive." 


- TAP Sync Test (All Tables):
  - Same Astropy Error mentioned above



Firethorn Query Test (All Tables):
  - Bad Status Line Exceptions


# Ongoing work and Plans

- Fixed issue with Health Checker running on my machine, which didn't recognize that OSA TAP VM had crashed
- Working on fixing Firethorn-Utils validation output (Need to output full exception)
- Testing 3 different ways of running the ALL-TABLES test on Firethorn
- Testing using TAPlint
- Plan on using ChaosMonkey to simulate exception in OGSADAI similar to the 823 Fatal error known issue, and documenting if this causes infinite loops or VM crashing
- .. 

# Taplint Validation pointed to VVVDR4 missing from ramses19?
# Checking ogsadai logs:
  Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Invalid object name 'VVVDR4.dbo.ProgrammeTable'.

# Don't inform Rob yet, run some tests to see if this will cause VM to crash again
