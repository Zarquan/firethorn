# Issue with Live WFAU TAP Services (October)

# On the weekend of October 17th our healthchecker started producing a number of error messages:

..
Health Check Results for: http://tap.roe.ac.uk/firethorn/system/info
HTTP Error 503: Service Unavailable /

# Check 1: Sync query
# -------------------

# First check was to check a simple query to the sync endpoint of one of our TAP services
# firefox http://tap.roe.ac.uk/osa/sync?REQUEST=doQuery&QUERY=SELECT+TOP+1+*+from+ATLASDR1.Filter&LANG=ADQL


# Exception 503


# Check 2: Docker ps
# ------------------

# Second check was to log into the VM to see if the Docker containers are up and running

# ssh Stevedore@Lothigometh

# ..ssh exception
# Not able to log into the machine at all
# It looks like the VM got locked up, an issue we've seen before



# See if we can restart machine
# ------------------------------

# VM did not successfully restart after kvm restart command


# Recreate VM and run import
# ------------------------------

# Service recovered after recreating Lothigometh and running the import scripts as defined here:
# http://wfau.metagrid.co.uk/code/firethorn/file/310132961970/doc/notes/stv/20200514-TAP-Swarm-deploy-2.1.36.txt

# As the endpoints produced matched what is already there in the Apache proxy, we did not have to edit the proxy config


# Service back up & running ..
