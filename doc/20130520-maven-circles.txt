# Circular dependencies in the maven build tree


The JDBC drivers in the database section are required by three separate sections.

    1) The hsqldb service exec
    2) The metadata, userdata and testdata database builds.  
    3) The core firethorn build and tests.

Problem is that the JDBC drivers depends on the top level firethorn project.
But .. building the top level project will build all the core firethorn components, which will fail their tests if the database isn't running.

Separate profiles .. ?

    Split the jdbc drivers into a separate project.
    Split the hsqldb server into a separate project.

Top level build.

    <profile>
        <id>hsqldb</id>
    </profile>

    <profile>
        <id>initdb</id>
    </profile>

    <profile>
        <id>webapp</id>
