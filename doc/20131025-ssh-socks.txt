# Using SSH to create a SOCKS proxy to access external resources.
#[user@laptop]

    #
    # Problem:
    # The WIFI network at ROE requires the local VPN,
    # which blocks a number of commonly used ports.
    #

    #
    # Connect a SOCKS proxy tunnel to an external host.
    ssh -D 2001 polyester.andrews.metagrid.co.uk
    
    #
    # Configure Jabber client to use SOCKS proxy on port 2001.
    # Type : SOCKS 5
    # Host : localhost
    # Port : 2001
    # Jabber traffic is now routed via the tunnel host,
    # avoiding the local network.

# Using SSH and VPN to create a SOCKS proxy for HTTP access.

    #
    # The following hack only works because our Andrews virtual machines
    # have both IPV4 and IPV6 addresses. 

    #
    # Install and configure the University VPN on polystyrene. 
    #[root@polystyrene]

        yum install vpnc

        vi /etc/vpnc/ed.ac.uk.conf

            IPSec gateway  ....
            IPSec ID       ....
            IPSec secret   ....
            Xauth username ....

        vpnc ed.ac.uk

            | You are connected to the University of Edinburgh enhanced VPN service.
            VPNC started in background (pid: 1697)...

        # This will route all IPV4 traffic via the VPN. 

    #
    # Connecting direct from ROE to polystyrene fails.
    #
    # This is probably because irrespective of where the requests come from,
    # replies to IPV4 connections will be routed via the university VPN.
    ssh -D 2002 root@polystyrene.andrews.metagrid.co.uk
        ....

    #
    # Create a polytunnel that connects to an intermediary,
    # and then connects to polystyrene using IPv6
    gedit ~/.ssh/config &

        Host polyhack
            HostName polystyrene.andrews.metagrid.co.uk 
            ProxyCommand ssh -q polyester.andrews.metagrid.co.uk nc %h %p

    ssh -D 2002 root@polyhack

    #
    # This routes the tunneled SOCKS proxy to polyester via polystyrene.
    # Because the connection between polyester and polystyrene is using IPV6
    # it is not effected by the changes to the IPV4 routing table setup by the University VPN  

    #
    # Update FireFox to use the SOCKS proxy on port 2002
    # Type : SOCKS 5
    # Host : localhost
    # Port : 2002

    #
    # IPV4 HTTP requests from FireFix will now be handled by the University VPN, tunneled via the SOCKS proxy.

    # IPV6 HTTP requests from FireFox will now be tunneled via the SOCKS proxy,
    # but not by the University VPN.
