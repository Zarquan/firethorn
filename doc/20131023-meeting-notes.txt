    LEGACY/ STRICT
    
    Re-write query ?
    Update the displayed query ?
    LEGACY / STRICT select box ?

    Default starts at LEGACY
    If we change things, tell user what we did
    Show what query was actually executed ?

    Update the free form box with the actual query.


#-------------------------------
#

    VOTable needs to have query as CDATA.
    Put whole ADQL query in header.

#-------------------------------
#

    List of errors rather than just one.
    
#-------------------------------
#
    Improve errors/warnings
    Sugest missing catalogs

    EDIT stage
    Parse query without executing it ?

    Detect duplicate field names
    warn, replace ....

    Detect unjoined cross join
    warn
