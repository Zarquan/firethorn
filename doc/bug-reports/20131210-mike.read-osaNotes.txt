File listing 
---------------------
Does not work unless you are logged in.
When you are logged in you only get ATLASDR1

The file listing only returns the number of HTML rows requested with no option to 
retrieve further rows. Either you need to get all matching rows in the original
query (potentially tens of thousands) and page through them in JS  or send subsequent 
requests off. The old form allowed used to select the number rows of results
default 100, the query did a select top 100+500 and then says here's a hundred
rows but there are at least N more, if the user requested the next 100 then
a new query top (200+500) is performed and the first 100 rows discarded etc and the
next 100 displayed. You can probably handle this all better now in JS datatables
but at the very least users need to know that they are not getting all the data.

Supplying a framesetid gives An error "occurred while executing your SQL query"

Change drop down list of filters to u,g,r,i,z eg see
http://surveys.roe.ac.uk:8080/osa/OImageList_form.jsp

When I click on view in the results I get a pop up saying 
"The page at osa.roe.ac.uk says there was an error processign your request."

But then when I click on OK the images are displayed.

If you click on one of the images to get the bigger version you can not get
back to the form as just used. i.e. the image opens in the browser and if you go back
you just go to osa top level.


GetImage
-------------


ATLASv20131029 is offline at the moment while Rob moves databases around
however GetImage just says 0 rows returned rather  than say unable to connect.


MultiGetImage
-------------

When you get results, again if you click on an individual image then you can't get back 
to your results easily (though you'll have the emailed link) as you end
up at osa home.

Region
---------

Does not work => "Query returned invalid data.. Please try another query"

Also can't enter galactic coords (greyed out).


Freeform query
--------------

Results files (FITS VOTABLE etc) do not contain query metadata, eg query
run, database(s) queried, date/time of query.

I see various issues with the plotter in Chrome, IE and Firefox.
Especiallly in the lower section click drag thing where in IE/chrome I can't
drag the sides and in Firefox once dragged I can't let go. This is in
mixed scatter/density mode doing a select top 1000 ra,dec from
atlasmergelog.

These are from Firefox

Things work better in normal scatter and histogram plots.
