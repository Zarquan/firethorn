Hi Dave,

thanks for quickly looking into this.

I think I just "solved" it.

I don't know what was going on, but I had to delete the query line by line =
and exactly retype some lines instead copy and pasting them.


Could it be that a new line or some characters like tab for example cause c=
onfusion in the window where you write the code?


Cheers

Nicola

Hi Nicola,

We are looking in to the issue to see if we can figure out what may be
causing the bad results you are getting.

Could you email me a copy of the full ADQL query that is getting bad
results.

Thanks,
Dave
