The issue seems to be with a recent change to networking.=20
The VMs no longer appear under /etc/hosts and are not accessible from djer.
Could anyone with access to that file add the following to /etc/hosts:

192.168.122.2   pyracantha
192.168.122.3   coccinea
192.168.122.4   malus
192.168.122.5   pyrus

Cheers,

Hello,

Apologies for that, there seems to be an issue on our end with the ADQL for=
m which we are looking into.
In the meantime you can try using the "Native SQL" option. On the same page=
 as the ADQL form you should notice the "Native SQL" tab, which will give f=
orm where you can query the SQL Server database directly.

We'll let you know when the ADQL form is back online.

Cheers,

Hi,

Today I tried to use the ADSQL form after a few weeks.

I cannot submit any kind of query and all I get is the error

"Please select from the list of endpoints".

Also after clicking on the Database(s) button I get a new window but no dat=
abase is shown and I cannot select one.

Is this a problem on my side?

Am I doing something wrong? It use to work before.


Thank you for your time.


Nicola Gentile Fusillo
