SQL cookbook.

In general change filter attributes in SQL and text eg ymifd -> gmfid. 
I would also change -0.5 and +0.5 to -5 and +5 just so some results are returned

SELECT mjdObs, ra, dec
FROM atlasMergeLog, Multiframe 
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -0.5 AND +0.5) 
AND (ymfID = multiframeID) AND (ymfID > 0) 

change to

SELECT mjdObs, ra, dec
FROM atlasMergeLog, Multiframe 
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -5 AND 5) 
AND (gmfID = multiframeID) AND (gmfID > 0) 


SELECT mjdObs AS yModifiedJulianDate, ra AS fieldCentreRA, dec AS fieldCentreDec
FROM atlasMergeLog, Multiframe 
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -0.5 AND +0.5) 
AND (ymfID = multiframeID) AND (ymfID > 0) 

change to

SELECT mjdObs AS yModifiedJulianDate, ra AS fieldCentreRA, dec AS fieldCentreDec
FROM atlasMergeLog, Multiframe 
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -5 AND 5) 
AND (gmfID = multiframeID) AND (gmfID > 0) 


SELECT mjdObs, ra, dec
FROM Multiframe 
JOIN atlasMergeLog ON (ymfID = multiframeID)
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -0.5 AND +0.5) AND (ymfID > 0) 

change to

SELECT mjdObs, ra, dec
FROM Multiframe 
JOIN atlasMergeLog ON (gmfID = multiframeID)
WHERE (dec BETWEEN -5 AND 5) AND (gmfID > 0) 

SELECT mjdObs 
FROM Multiframe
WHERE multiframeID IN
 (SELECT ymfID FROM atlasMergeLog WHERE (dec BETWEEN -0.5 AND +0.5) AND (ymfID > 0)) 

change to

SELECT mjdObs 
FROM Multiframe
WHERE multiframeID IN
 (SELECT gmfID FROM atlasMergeLog WHERE (dec BETWEEN -5 AND 5) AND (gmfID > 0)) 


SELECT mjdObs 
FROM Multiframe
WHERE multiframeID = ANY
 (SELECT ymfID FROM atlasMergeLog WHERE (dec BETWEEN -0.5 AND +0.5) AND (ymfID > 0)) 

change to

SELECT mjdObs 
FROM Multiframe
WHERE multiframeID = ANY
 (SELECT gmfID FROM atlasMergeLog WHERE (dec BETWEEN -5 AND 5) AND (gmfID > 0)) 

however ANY does not work, so either query needs changing or "parser", the
text following this SQL might also need changing depending on what is done

SELECT AVG(jAperMag3)
FROM atlasSource 
WHERE jAperMag3 > 0.0 

change to

SELECT AVG(rAperMag3)
FROM atlasSource 
WHERE rAperMag3 > 0.0


In trying 

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ProgrammeFrame 

I got

There was an error on the server while processing your request.

( XMLHttpRequest: Network Error 0x2f78, Could not complete the operation due to error 00002f78.)

Tried it again and it worked.

Problem with log/log10 queries ?

SELECT top 1 log10(ra) from atlasmergelog 
SELECT top 1 log(ra) from atlasmergelog

Query error: A problem occurred while running your query

Problem with pi ?

SELECT top 1 pi()*ra from atlasmergelog

Query error: PARSE_ERROR - [java.lang.NullPointerException] Impossible to update an Operation with a left operand equals to NULL !

Problem with round (might be me not understanding syntax)

SELECT top 1 round(ra,0) from atlasmergelog

Query error: PARSE_ERROR - [java.lang.NullPointerException] Impossible to build an Operation without an operation type (SUM, SUB, MULT or DIV) !

Problem with rand

SELECT top 1 rand(1) from atlasmergelog

Query error: A problem occurred while running your query

problem with sign ?

SELECT top 1 sign(-3) from atlasmergelog

Query error: A problem occurred while running your query

problem with square ?

SELECT top 1 square(4) from atlasmergelog

Query error: A problem occurred while running your query

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Multiframe WHERE project LIKE "U/UKIDSS/ATLAS%" 

change to

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Multiframe WHERE project LIKE '%ATLAS%'

NB single quotes

problem with 

SELECT -MIN(decBase) FROM Multiframe WHERE MultiframeID > 0 

There was an error processing your request
