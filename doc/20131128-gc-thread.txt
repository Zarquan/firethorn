        Supervised
            Classification
            Regression

            Classifies into known sets

        Unsupervised 
            Clustering
            Dimensional reduction

            Finds unknown sets

            Self organising maps
            Based on similarity between two vectors
            usually squared euclidian distance
            
        Hadoop not great for iterative processing
        HaLoop .. ?
