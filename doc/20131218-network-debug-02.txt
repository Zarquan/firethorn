    * The /etc/hosts on shep lists ramses9 as 192.168.0.12

#
# 'dnsmasq' sounds interesting, quick Google to see what it is ... 
#
# It looks like the KVM servers might be using dnsmasq to provide NAT and DNS to their KVM guests.
#
# According to the manual, dnsmasq will pick up entries in the local /etc/hosts file
# and use them to enhance the DNS service provided to the KVM guests.
# http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html

    Dnsmasq is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
    It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.

        * The DNS configuration of machines behind the firewall is simple and doesn't depend on the details of the ISP's dns servers
        * Clients which try to do DNS lookups while a modem link to the internet is down will time out immediately.
        * Dnsmasq will serve names from the /etc/hosts file on the firewall machine: If the names of local machines are there, then they can all be addressed without having to maintain /etc/hosts on each machine.

# The comments in /etc/hosts on shepseskaf suggest that 192.168.0.* addresses are using Infiniband.

    For a port forwarded SSL tunnel

        ssh -L '*:8081:unknowable:80' user@server

    The SSH service, sshd, on the server will use a combination of
    sources to resolve the 'unknowable' hostname.

    The default configuration is to use 
    
        1) The local DNS service.
        2) The contents of the /etc/hosts file. 

    The combination of resolvers is configured in the Name Service Switch configutation.

    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_Service_Switch

        cat /etc/nsswitch.conf

            hosts:      files dns

    The NSSwitch configuation is checked when the SSH tunnel is created,
    i.e. when the client connects.
    
        ssh -L '*:8081:unknowable:80' user@server

    The the 'unknowable' hostname itself is resolved at the point when the ssh tunnelled connection is used,
    i.e. when something tries to connect to the client end of the tunnel.
