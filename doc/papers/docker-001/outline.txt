What is Docker

    Lightweight virtualization.
    No Hypervisor.
    Not a virtual machine.

    Linux namespaces create a bubble

    Docker uses Linux namespaces to create 'containers'.
    
    Containers are a standard size and shape enabling the use of standard tools to manage
    them irrespective of what they contain analogous to the way that shipping containers
    have changed the transportation of physical goods. 
    
Why we wanted to use Docker

    Repeatable rapid testing.
    configuring external components e.g. databases etc.

    Repeatable rapid deployment.
    
    Agile deployment and testing infrastructure components.
    e.g - Java versions, Tomcat versions etc.
