Abstract

    Lessons learned from using Docker
    for deployment and testing

Why Docker

    repeatable automatable testing
    repeatable automatable deployment

    better control of support environment
        java version
        tomcat version

    better control over orchestration
        deploy and test a set of services as a unit
        automation means everything gets written down

        works on my machine becomes
            reproducable
            portable

    managing virtual machines
        dependencies
        deployment

    managing cloud deployment
        

Container types

    WebService containers

        (Java + Tomcat) + webapp

        (Apache + WebPy) + Python

    Support services

        JDBC connections
            ambasador abstraction
            
        Metadata database
            
        Test statistics database

    Build tools
    
        Maven
        Mercurial
        Docker

        sqlsh

        ivoatex

Tricks learned

    mount unix sockets 

        docker in docker
            mount docker sock

        ssh in docker
            mount ssh sock

    ambasadors

        socat proxy
        
            issues with original ambasador
                https://hub.docker.com/r/svendowideit/ambassador/
                original idea
                http://docs.docker.com/engine/articles/ambassador_pattern_linking/
                source code not published until later
                https://github.com/SvenDowideit/dockerfiles/blob/master/ambassador/Dockerfile
                easy enough to roll our own

            unix to http docker sock

            JDBC proxy
                
            JDBC over SSH proxy

    rolling your own
    
        docker makes it easy
        open source makes it easy to copy ideas
        start with binary blobs
        work back up the tree creating our own
            socat
            java + tomcat
            fedora

        fine grained control over versions        

Issues found

    Memory leak with logging

        Original docker logging to JSON

    Docker version
        host version
        docker in docker version

    Docker registry
        fedora mis-tagged

    storage drivers
        lvm
        btrfs

    Conflict with libvirtd on RedHat/Fedora

Moving target

    Memory issues fixed

    Docker registry

    Docker compose
    Docker storage
    Docker network
