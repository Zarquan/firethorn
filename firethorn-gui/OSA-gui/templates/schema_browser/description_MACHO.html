<p> The <b>MACHO Archive</b> is an implementation of catalogues of
the <a href=http://macho.anu.edu.au/ target=_top>MACHO Project</a>.
The MACHO Project is a collaboration between scientists at the Mt. Stromlo &amp; Siding Spring Observatories, the Center for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, &amp; Berkeley campuses of the University of California, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Their primary aim is to test the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the dark matter in the halo of the Milky Way is made up of objects like brown dwarfs or planets: these objects have come to be known as MACHOs, for MAssive Compact Halo Objects. The signature of these objects is the occasional amplification of the light from extragalactic stars by the gravitational lens effect. The amplification can be large, but events are extremely rare: it is necessary to monitor photometrically several million stars for a period of years in order to obtain a useful detection rate. For this purpose the MACHO project have built a two channel system that employs eight 2048*2048 CCDs, mounted on the 50 inch telescope at Mt. Stromlo. The high data rate (several GBytes per night) is accommodated by custom electronics and on-line data reduction.
