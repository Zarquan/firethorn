The <b>Gaia-ESO Survey</b> science archive comprises calibrated one- and
two-dimensional spectra for stars observed in the
<a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/observing/policies/PublicSurveys/sciencePublicSurveys.html">
GES survey</a>
and a variety of astrophysical parameters (heliocentric radial
velocity, effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity <i>etc</i>)
derived from these spectra.
</p>

<p>
GES is a public spectroscopic survey of approximately 100,000 stars,
systematically covering all the major components of the Milky Way, from the
halo to star-forming regions and providing the first homogeneous overview of
the distributions of kinematics and elemental abundances.  The target stars
were observed using the
<a href="http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/paranal/instruments/flames/">
FLAMES spectrograph</a>
on the
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/">ESO</a>
<a href="http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt.html">VLT</a>
at Paranal in Chile.  The survey was conducted in support of the
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaCP/index.html">ESA</a>
<a href="http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=GAIA&page=index">Gaia</a>
astrometric satellite, but will have numerous other uses.
</p>

<p>
GES includes stars representative of the main components of the Galaxy:
inner and outer bulge, inner and outer thick and thin discs, the halo and
known halo streams.  There is a special focus on open clusters of all ages
and on solar neighbourhood field stars, as these trace both stellar and
Galactic evolution, complement the Gaia astrometry, and will benefit most
from the most precise Gaia data.  Specifically, the survey includes the
following components or programmes:
</p>

<ul color=#ffffff class='d'>
  <li><p>Bulge Survey,</p></li>
  <li><p>Halo/Thick Disc Survey,</p></li>
  <li><p>Outer Thick Disc, 2-4 kpc from the Sun,</p></li>
  <li><p>Thin Disc Dynamics,</p></li>
  <li><p>Solar Neighbourhood,</p></li>
  <li><p>Open Clusters.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The entire GES survey is organised in a single schema, which includes tables,
views, indices and constraints.
