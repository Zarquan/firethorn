<p> The <b>TWODFGRS Archive</b> is an implementation of the <a href=http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS/ target=_top>2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey</a>.
The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is a major spectroscopic survey taking
full advantage of the unique capabilities of the 2dF facility built by the
Anglo-Australian Observatory. The 2dFGRS is integrated with the 2dF QSO survey.
The 2dFGRS obtained spectra for 245591 objects, mainly galaxies, brighter than
a nominal extinction-corrected magnitude limit of bJ=19.45. Reliable
(quality&ge;3) redshifts were obtained for 221414 galaxies. The galaxies cover
an area of approximately 1500 square degrees selected from the extended APM
Galaxy Survey in three regions: an NGP strip, an SGP strip and random fields
scattered around the SGP strip.
