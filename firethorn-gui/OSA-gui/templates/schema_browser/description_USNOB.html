<p> The <b>USNOB Archive</b> is an implementation of the <a href=http://ftp.nofs.navy.mil/projects/pmm/catalogs.html target=_top>USNO-B1.0 Catalogue </a>
that presents positions, proper motions, magnitudes in various optical
passbands, and star/galaxy estimators for 1,045,175,762 objects derived
from 3,648,832,040 separate observations. The data were taken from scans
of 7,435 Schmidt plates taken from various sky surveys during the last
50 years.<br>
The catalogue is expected to be complete down to V=21; the estimated
accuracies are 0.2arcsec for the positions at J2000, 0.3mag in up to 5
colors, and 85% accuracy for distinguishing stars from non-stellar
objects.
