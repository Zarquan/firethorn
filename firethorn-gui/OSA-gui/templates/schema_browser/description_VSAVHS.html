<p>The <b>VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS)</b> is a panoramic Infra-Red survey,
which when combined with other large area VISTA Public Surveys (i.e. VIKING,
VVV, VMC) will result in coverage of the whole southern celestial
hemisphere (&sim;20,000deg<sup>2</sup>) to a depth &sim;4 magnitudes fainter
than 2MASS/DENIS in
at least two wavebands J and Ks. In the South Galactic Cap,
&sim;5000deg<sup>2</sup> will
be imaged deeper, including H band, and will have supplemental deep multi-band
grizY imaging data provided by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The remainder
of the high galactic latitude sky will be imaged in YJHKs combined with ugriz
wavebands from the VST ATLAS survey. The medium term scientific goals include:
<ul color=#ffffff class='d'>
<li> a huge expansion in our knowledge of; </li>
<li> the lowest-mass and nearest stars; </li>
<li> deciphering the merger history our own Galaxy; </li>
<li> measurement of large-scale structure out to z&cong;1 and measuring the properties of Dark Energy; </li>
<li> discovery of the first quasar with z&gt;7. </li>
</ul><p>
In addition the survey will provide essential support for the ESA Cornerstone
missions; XMM-Newton, Planck, Herschel and GAIA.<br>
