<p>The <b>VESPA Archive</b>
is the main repository for VESPA runs on SDSS spectra.
<p>
The database is currently split into seven tables:
<ul>
<li> <em>GalProp</em> includes results relative to the galaxy as a whole,</li>
<li> <em>BinProp</em> has results which refer to each age bin individually, in the
original resolution as recovered by VESPA,</li>
<li> <em>HRBinProp</em> splits the recovered solutions into the highest possible
resolution (16 age bins), using the appropriate weights,</li>
<li> <em>DustProp</em> holds dust information,</li>
<li> <em>BinID</em> identifies each VESPA low- or high-resolution bin,</li>
<li> <em>RunProp</em> holds run-specific details, such as SSP and dust models used,</li>
<li> <em>LookupTable</em> links VESPA's unique identifier with SDSS's own identifiers,
such as specObjID, plate, MJD and fiber ID.</li>
</ul>
Galaxies are identified by a unique index, which can be associated with
SDSS's specObjID via the table LookupTable.
