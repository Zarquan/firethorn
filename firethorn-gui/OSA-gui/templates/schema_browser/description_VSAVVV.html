<p>The <b>VISTA VARIABLES in the Via Lactea (VVV)</b> a public IR variability
survey of the Milky Way bulge and an adjacent section of the mid-plane
where star formation activity is high. This would take 1920 hours, covering
&sim;10<sup>9</sup> point sources within an area of 520 sq deg, including 33
known globular
clusters and &sim;350 open clusters. The final products will be a deep
IR atlas in 5 passbands and a catalogue of &sim;10<sup>6</sup> variable point
sources.
These will produce a 3-D map of the surveyed region (unlike single-epoch
surveys that only give 2-D maps) using well-understood primary distance
indicators such as RR Lyrae stars. It will yield important information on
the ages of the populations. The observations will be combined with data
from MACHO, OGLE, EROS, VST, SPITZER, HST, CHANDRA, INTEGRAL, and ALMA for
a complete understanding of the variable sources in the inner Milky Way.
Several important implications for the history of the Milky Way, for globular
cluster evolution, for the population census of the bulge and center, and
for pulsation theory would follow from this survey. <br>
