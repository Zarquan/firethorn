<p>The main science goals of the <b>VISTA Magellanic Survey (VMC)</b> survey
are the determination of the spatially resolved star formation history (SFH)
and the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of the system. The VMC survey will
reach sources 6 mag fainter compared to the 2MASS and DENIS  surveys which
sample down to only upper red giant branch stars. VMC data will include the
entire red giant branch population, short period variables and in particular
old RR Lyrae stars, down to the oldest main sequence turn-off stars. These
and other science goals that will be addressed with VMC data are described
below. The VMC survey is strongly linked and complementary to other
spectroscopic and photometric surveys of the Magellanic system, which will
benefit from each other, providing a new, complete and absolutely unique
view of this system.<br>
