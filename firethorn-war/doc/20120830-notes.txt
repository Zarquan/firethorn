For now, concentrate on the HTML forms, not web service API.

    #
    # Service metadata.
    GET /adql/services
    => html meta

    #
    # Select all.
    GET /adql/services/select
    => List<Service> 

    #
    # Select by name
    GET /adql/services/select?name=albert
    => List<Service> 

    #
    # Search by text (form)
    GET /adql/services/search
    => HTML form

    #
    # Search by text
    GET /adql/services/search?text=albert
    => List<Service> 


    #
    # Create form
    GET /adql/services/create
    => HTML form

    #
    # Create operation
    POST /adql/services/create 
    => 201 created, location:/adql/service/{sid}


    #
    # Details of a specific service (singular).
    GET /adql/service/{sid}
    => Service

    #
    # Metadata for the service resource list.
    GET /adql/service/{sid}/resources
    => html meta

    #
    # Select all
    GET /adql/service/{sid}/resources/select
    => List<Resource>

    #
    # Select by name
    GET /adql/service/{sid}/resources/select?name=xxxx
    => List<Resource>

    #
